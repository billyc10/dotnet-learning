# .NET API Learning Project #
This is a project to learn about creating Web APIs in .NET
I will be building the API with as little boilerplates as possible, and document the journey along the way.

The current plan is to build a restaurant review API, which a client can query to retrieve reviews and ratings for restaurants, as well as submit new reviews.
